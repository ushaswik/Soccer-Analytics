# Soccer Database Project

## Problem Statement
This project involves the creation and management of a comprehensive soccer database. The goal is to facilitate easy storage, retrieval, and analysis of soccer-related data including competitions, clubs, players, games, and various statistics related to these entities.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ER diagram provided outlines the structure of the soccer database. It includes nine main entities:

- Competitions: Details about soccer competitions.
- Clubs: Information about the clubs participating in the competitions.
- Players: Profiles and statistics of the players.
- Games: Records of individual games played in the competitions.
- Player Valuations: Market valuation data for the players.
- Game Lineups: Information about player lineups for each game.
- Game Events: Details of events that occurred during games.
- Club Games: Details linking clubs to the games they've played.
- Appearances: Data about player appearances in games.

The relationships between these entities are represented by lines connecting them, with symbols indicating the nature of the relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.). Constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and not-null constraints are also depicted in the ERD.

## SQL Execution Steps
To set up the database, follow these steps:

1. Run the `create.sql` script to create the tables and relationships. This file contains the SQL statements necessary for defining the schema of the soccer database.

2. Populate the database by executing the `load.sql` script, which should contain INSERT statements for each table.

Ensure that you have the appropriate database management system installed, and the required permissions to create and modify databases.

## Query Execution Comments
Once the database is set up, you can run queries to retrieve or manipulate the data as needed. Remember to follow the best practices for SQL query execution and always back up your database before performing any operation that might affect the data integrity.

For more detailed information on running specific queries or for troubleshooting, refer to the project's documentation or reach out to the database administrator.
